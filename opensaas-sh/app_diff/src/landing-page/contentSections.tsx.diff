I‚Äôve done plenty of with  react in the past but I‚Äôm a front end person.  With wasp though, I'm managing my db, back end functions, actions, queries, all with so much ease. I occasionally get stuck on an issue but within a day or two, and thanks to a couple of AI assistants, I get through it. So thank you!",
